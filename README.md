# Simple Investment Calculator

## What is this sorcery?
Investing into the financial markets is very easy. Using your bank / broker to place an order and hope that the order gets matched and executed.
The goal of this simple investment calculator is not to create an in-depth analysis tool - but rather show simple compound interest effects according to your hypothetical data.
